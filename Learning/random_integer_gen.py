# We use random.randint(a,b) to get a random integer between two and this will include a and b also
# First we will import random library to implement randomisation in this code.
import random
# Now we will create a variable which will store the random integer
Random_int = random.randint(1,100)
# Now we will print this random integer
print(Random_int)
