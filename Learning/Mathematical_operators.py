# In this file we are going to make statements that will use mathematical operators 
# Adding two integers
a = 1+2
# Subtracting two integers
b = 2-1
# multiplying two integers
c = 1*2
# divinding an integer with another integer
d = 2/1
# finding the remainder after dividing an integer with another integer
e = 2%1
# finding the exponential of any number for e.g. 2**3 here the output will be 8
f = 2**3
print(float(a))

# Python follows PEMDASLR(paranthesis>exponential>multiply=division>add=subtract)Left>Right rule when multiple operators are in a single code of line for e.g.
print(float(3-1)**float(2*3)/2+float(2-2))
