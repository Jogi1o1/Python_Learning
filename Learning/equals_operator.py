# We can use an mathematical operator in front of equals to to update the previous value of that variable
# Here we defined a variable named length
Length = 2
# Here we are multiplying the value of length with 2 to store an updated value in variable length
Length *= 2
# Here we are printing the value of length
print(Length)
