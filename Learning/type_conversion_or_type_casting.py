# # Type Conversion is automatically done by the python interpretor
# # For ex
# a = 12
# b = 21.12
# sum = a+b #Here the a which is integer will automatically converted into float before adding in b
# print(round(sum,2))
#
# # Type Casting is done by the developer in the code itself
# c = "12"
# d = 21.21
# sums = int(c) + d #Here we are manually typecasting a string into an integer
# print(round(sums,2))
